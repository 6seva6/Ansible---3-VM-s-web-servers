# Ansible Playbooks  

In this repository, I store my **case scenarios** related to **Ansible configuration system**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each file contains:  
- ✅ **Scenario description** with detailed steps.  
- 🛠 **Required software and dependencies** for execution.  
- ⚠️ **Errors encountered and their resolutions**.  
- 📷 **Screenshots and logs** for reference.  

This repository serves as a **learning resource** and a **proof of hands-on experience** with Ansible.
